1. Does the site work as-is, or did you need to tweak it to work?

   **The site works as-is, though it's simpler than the original. There is no color and the overall look is boring. The drop-down menu works and changes the election results for each county you choose.**

2. Try improving the result, and updating the files based on the results. Did that help?

3. Think of a journalism circumstance where you might use this sort of technique that doesn't involve elections. Describe how you would do it.
