### LLM Demos

A place to explore some work with LLMs.

Start with [this data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_pres_county.csv).

**_Here's my Chat GPT Link: https://chatgpt.com/share/6817afd6-9df4-8010-9717-09d71bb8cd1d_**
1. Does the site work as-is, or did you need to tweak it to work?

   **The site works as-is, though it's simpler than the original. There is no color and the overall look is boring. The drop-down menu works and changes the election results for each county you choose.**

2. Try improving the result, and updating the files based on the results. Did that help?

   **This definitely helped! I created two folders with the first and second attempts so you can easily see both. The first is boring, but the second is more colorful and eye-catching, and I didn't even have to beg Chat GPT more than once!**
   
3. Think of a journalism circumstance where you might use this sort of technique that doesn't involve elections. Describe how you would do it.

   **It would be good for an easy way to check through local sports scores from the previous night, you could use a dropdown menu for the team or sport, depending on how ambitious you wanted to be, and you could upload all the scores pretty easily and have it poof-ed into a magical interactive spreadsheet. That's pretty sweet!**
